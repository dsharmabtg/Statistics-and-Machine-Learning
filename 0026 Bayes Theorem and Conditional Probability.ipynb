    "## Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "It is said that the Reverend Thomas Bayes developed his rule on inverse probability while he was trying to prove the existence of God somewhere around 1740. He came up with a method for calculating the probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. Starting out with the prior probability (or believe) $P(A)$, when given a likelihood) $P(B\\ |\\ A)$ and evidence $P(B)$ we arrive at the posterior probability $P(A\\ |\\ B)$. Bayes Rule proves to be a powerful tool and is widely used in diverging areas like economics, artificial intelligence, medicine, journalism, military, just to name a few. Most spam filters use Bayes Rule in one way or another. The Bayes' Theorem formula is, posterior = likelihood times prior, over evidence:\n",

This statistic is hard to figure out, but we do know from medical studies the probability of someone being a smoker given that he/she has COPD - $P(B|A)$.

    "### Test Accuracy Example\n",
    "Where Bayes' Rule shines is when we have evidence (for instance a test result) which is not 100% accurate. Let's say we have a test for detecting cancer. The probability of this test returning a positive result given the person has cancer is 99% (called the [sensitivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity)). The specificity is 93% and denotes the probability of having a negative test result given the person has no cancer. The cancer prevalence is 1% (proportion of people having cancer of the total population).\n",
